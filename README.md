# FAQ

#### "Why Roboto Condensed?"

I had previous used Fira Code as the theme's chosen font, mostly because I use Horizon in VSCode in conjuction with Fira Code. As I began to use Obsidian more intensely, however, these things became clear:
- Coding ligatures were rarely used in Obsidian. 
- I needed support for Vietnamese, which Fira Code lacked.  

Roboto Condensed was then chosen for the reasons above. In addition, it's free to use.

You may wish to add/switch to a different font for some reasons such as:
- You code/display code often in Obsidian and need ligatures.
- You want to use different fonts for header, body, graph. Keep in mind that this will likely increase loading time on Obsidian Publish.

#### "Light color scheme?"

No currently and is not planned. The existing Horizon light palette does not suit Obsidian. An alternative light color palette can be suggested by creating a pull request/ issue.

#### "Can you port this for X app?"

No.

#### "How do I contribute?"

I welcome all manners of contributions: fixes, comments, suggestions, and critques. Feel free to open an issue with your proposed changes and a short description. Moreover, creating a pull request with the prposed changes will make it much easier for me to implement, test, and preview those changes.
