# About
- Compatible and stylized for Obsidian, as well as Publish, and Obsidian Mobile.
Horizon is dark theme for Obsidian, inspired by the same [Horizon Theme for Visual StudioCode](https://horizontheme.netlify.app/). Though there are a few key differences:
- The theme's base colors also include a new pasty yellow meant to pop/catch attention.
- The theme will be a dark mode exlusive for now. The existing light palette is not to my satisfaction. If anyone has a complementing light color palette that suits this theme, feel free to create an issue/pull request.
