# FAQ

#### "What is Horizon?"

Horizon is a dark theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It is inspired (a color fork) by but not a direct port of the similarly named theme for VSCode. Compatible with Obsidian Desktop, [Mobile](https://obsidian.md/mobile), and [Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). 

#### "How do I keep my theme updated?"
Currently, there is no automatic solution available. For now, I recommend you create a GitHub watch alert for releases. Then, when the theme is updated, you can install the new version.  

#### "Why Roboto Condensed?"

I had previous used [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as the theme's chosen font, mostly because I use Horizon in VSCode in conjuction with Fira Code. As I began to use Obsidian more intensely, however, these things became clear:
- Coding ligatures were rarely used in Obsidian. 
- I needed support for Vietnamese, which Fira Code lacked.  

[Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed) was then chosen for the reasons above. In addition, it's free to use.

You may wish to add/switch to a different font for some reasons such as:
- You code/display code often in Obsidian and need ligatures.
- You want to use different fonts for header, body, graph. Keep in mind that this will likely increase loading time on Obsidian Publish.

#### "Is there a light color scheme?"

No currently and is not planned. The existing Horizon light palette does not suit Obsidian. An alternative light color palette can be suggested by creating a pull request/ issue. Though the dark mode is the primary focus of this theme.  

#### "Can you port this for X app?"

No.
