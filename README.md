> # About
- Compatible and stylized for Obsidian, as well as Publish, and Obsidian Mobile.
Horizon is dark theme for Obsidian, inspired by the same [Horizon Theme for Visual StudioCode](https://horizontheme.netlify.app/). The theme incorporate upstream base colors while also using a new pastel yellow, green, and blue. Hence, it is not a port but something partially new.

> # FAQ

#### "Why Roboto Condensed?"

I had previous used Fira Code as the theme's chosen font, mostly because I use Horizon in VSCode in conjuction with Fira Code. As I began to use Obsidian more intensely, however, these things became clear:
    - Coding ligatures were rarely used in Obsidian.
    - I needed support for Vietnamese, which Fira Code lacked.
Roboto Condensed was then chosen for the reasons above. In addition, it's free to use.

#### "Light color scheme?"

No currently and is not planned. The existing Horizon light palette does not suit Obsidian. An alternative light color palette can be suggested by creating a pull request/ issue.

#### "Can you port this for X app?"

No.

#### "How do I contribute?"

I welcome all manners of contributions: fixes, comments, suggestions, and critques. Feel free to open an issue with your proposed changes and a short description. Moreover, creating a pull request with the prposed changes will make it much easier for me to implement, test, and preview those changes.
